What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Prior to initializing a repository, changes are not tracked with git. By 
initializing you tag the repository as one in which you want to track 
changes. Git does not create the first commit when initialized: that is up 
to the user, but it does prepare it to allow you to do so.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to choose which files in a repository will be 
included in a given commit. In this way you can commit only those files
that you changed. It helps with the concept of "one logical change per
commit" by reducing the number of potential files that might need to be
looked through to determine where the changes in a commit are.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

By ensuring you have only one file in the staging area when you commit you 
can greatly reduce the chance that you will have more than one logical 
change per commit, although it won't necessarily negate the chance. You 
can still have multiple logical changes in a single file, but it is more 
difficult to have one logical change across multiple files.
