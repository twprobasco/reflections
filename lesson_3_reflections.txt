When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository is best when you are switching between machines (home computer and work computer) 
or when you are collaborating with others on a project, and the others are geographically diverse and each
working from their own computer. A remote repository allows access from multiple locations as long as the
machines have access to the repository.
