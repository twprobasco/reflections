When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository is best when you are switching between 
machines (home computer and work computer) or when you are 
collaborating with others on a project, and the others are 
geographically diverse and each working from their own computer. A 
remote repository allows access from multiple locations as long as the 
machines have access to the repository.

WHy might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not always be connected to the internet, thereby not having 
access to the remote repository. It also gives you an extra level of 
control and security, in case there is malicious code in a remote 
repository.

Describe the differenecs between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?

Branches are copies of the files in a repository made locally. The local machine has the rights to modify and change files in a branch. Clones and forks are similar, in that they are copies of remote repositories. Clones however copy the remote to a local machine, while forks copy the remote to your github. You may or may not have rights to commit changes to a clone, but not to a fork.
